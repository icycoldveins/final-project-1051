      <h3>1.Shiba Inu</h3>
     <p>The shiba is one of the best dogs to me because it is "the" meme dog, 
         they are small and have nice fur and their tails are curled on their backs which make them
        look really cool</p>

        <h3>2.Beagle</h3>
    <p>The Beagle is another one of my favorites, my grandma owned a beagle and she was very friendly and knew tricks</p>

        <h3>3.Corgis</h3>
        <p>Corgis are really fluffy and have short stubby legs that make them very cute and they used to
        be owned by the queen of england</p>

        <h3>4.Golden Retriever</h3>
        <p>The golden retriever is the first dog that I think of
            when I think of dogs, They are very friendly looking and have
            big noses that look cool
        </p>
