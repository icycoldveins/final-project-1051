# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong Four Player

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The game pong with the addition of two players

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will use 2 AI controlled paddles that will try to deflect the ball and the user has to control two paddles to prevent the ball from going out. My code will be using the Lua language and with the love framework. It will be executed by changing the speed of the paddles and writing code that deflects when the ball hits the paddle.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to be able to learn a new language and get a good chunk of the project done

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can learn the Lua programming language and the framework 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to finish the final project and create a four player pong and make it work 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I would download the framework, then I would need to learn the Lua programming language and then change add and change code for four paddles. I would need to research more about the Lua programming language and more about the LOVE framework. I would look at the projects distribution code and edit code for the paddles and possible edit the code that controls the movement of the paddles.
